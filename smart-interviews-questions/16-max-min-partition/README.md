# Max Min Partition 

Given an array D of positive integers, your goal is to divide D into two separate arrays, E and F, under the following conditions:Each element in array D must belong to either array E or array FBoth arrays E and F are non-emptyThe objective is to minimize the partition's value, calculated as the absolute difference between the maximum value of array E (denoted as max(E)) and the minimum value of array F (denoted as min(F))Print the resulting integer that represents the value of this partition.

## Input Format

The first line of input contains N. The second line of input contains an array of size N.

## Output Format

Print the minimized partition value.

## Constraints

2 ≤ N ≤ 104
1 ≤ Di ≤ 109

## Example

### Input

6
7 1 14 16 30 4

### Output

2

## Explanation

We can partition the array D into E = [7, 1, 14, 4] and F = [16, 30].The maximum element of the array E is equal to 14.The minimum element of the array F is equal to 16.The value of the partition is |14 - 16| = 2. It can be proven that 2 is the minimum value out of all the partitions.
